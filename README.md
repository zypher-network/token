## üîç Overview

The Zypher Token (POP) serves as the core value carrier of the Zypher Network ecosystem,
functioning as mining rewards, AI Agent verification payment, governance token,
and cross-platform collaboration medium within the ZK-powered trustless computing network.

Built on the battle-tested OpenZeppelin ERC-20 standard,
POP enables seamless transactions, staking rewards, privacy-preserving AI services,
and decentralized governance participation across the entire ecosystem.

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Standard Compliance**: Fully compliant with ERC-20 token standard
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Supply**: Capped at 10 billion tokens with no minting capability
- ‚úÖ **Security First**: Built using OpenZeppelin's audited contracts
- ‚úÖ **Exchange Ready**: Standard implementation for seamless exchange listings

## üåê Multi-Chain Deployment

POP will be deployed across multiple blockchain networks to ensure broad accessibility and interoperability.
The deployment follows a strategic phased approach with rigorous security measures and supply cap management.

### Deployment Strategy

The total supply of POP tokens is capped at **10 billion tokens** across all blockchain networks.
The deployment process is carefully managed through:

- **Phased Rollout**: Strategic release of tokens across different networks based on ecosystem maturity and user demand
- **Multi-Signature Security**: All cross-chain deployments are secured by multi-signature wallets requiring multiple authorized signatures
- **Supply Cap Management**: Strict monitoring ensures the combined total supply across all networks never exceeds the 10B cap
- **Transparent Process**: All deployment transactions and supply distributions are publicly verifiable on-chain

### Phase 1 Networks

- **BNB Chain**
- **Ethereum Mainnet**

### Network Configuration

Each deployment maintains identical token parameters while leveraging network-specific optimizations for gas efficiency and user experience. The smart contracts across all networks implement the same security standards and functionality to ensure consistent user experience.

## üîí Security

### Security Measures

1. **OpenZeppelin Foundation**: Built on industry-standard, audited contracts
2. **Immutable Design**: No upgrade mechanisms
3. **Standard Compliance**: Full ERC-20 compatibility reduces integration risks
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage for all functionality
